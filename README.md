**Sentiment Analysis using qdap library**

The key aspect of sentiment analysis is to analyze a body of text for understanding the opinion expressed by it. Typically, we quantify this sentiment with a positive or negative value, called polarity. The overall sentiment is often inferred as positive, neutral or negative from the sign of the polarity score.

**Polarity** is float which lies in the range of **[-1,1]** where **1 means positive statement and -1 means a negative statement**. Subjective sentences generally refer to personal opinion, emotion or judgment whereas objective refers to factual information. Subjectivity is also a float which lies in the range of [0,1].



**Latent Dirichlet Allocation** 
The purpose of LDA is to learn the representation of a fixed number of topics, and given this number of topics, learn the topic distribution that each document in a collection of documents has. It is one of the topic modeling technique.
